## 🛠️ Bot Functionality

Evelynn Bot operated by automatically leveling up League of Legends accounts. Here’s how it worked:

- **Automated Gameplay**: Accounts added at level 0 via the web dashboard were queued into matches automatically. Using its AI capabilities, the bot played games until the accounts reached level 30 or any desired level.
- **Multi-Account Processing**: Depending on system resources, the bot could handle up to 20 accounts simultaneously.
- **Completely Autonomous**: All processes were fully automated, allowing users to manage and track progress effortlessly through a user-friendly dashboard.
- **Development Challenges**: While the project aimed to streamline account leveling, it was developed over several years with many flaws, limitations, and amateur-level execution.
